Implementation of the Universal Force Field (UFF) in deMonNano
--------------------------------------------------------------

As far as possible, UFF molecular mechanics forcefield in deMon
follows the published forcefield definition in [1]. In several
cases, the definitions and expressions in [1] are not consistent
with the published applications of the forcefield [1,5,6].
In those cases, an attempt was made to correct the errors and omissions,
using information from [2].

The following changed were made, compared to the published UFF
forcefield description (all equation and page numbers refer to [1]).

1. Sign error in Eq. 2 (equilibrium bond length) was corrected
   - electronegativity correction must be negative!

2. Equilibrium valence angle for O_3_z was corrected from 146.0
   degree to 145.45 degree.

3. Bending periodicity (Eq. 10) for linear coordination was
   corrected from 1 to 2.

4. Sign errors were corrected in eqs. 13 and and unnumbered equation
   for the beta parameter (between eqs. 13 and 14).

5. The reference value of the UFF amide force constant, of 105.5
   kcal/mol/rad**2 (p. 10028) is wrong. The results are consistent
   with the force constant of 211.0 kcal/mol/rad**2.

6. Equilibrium torsional angle for a bond between a group-6A atom
   (oxygen ...) and an sp2 atom (90 degree) is wrong (p. 10028).
   It should be 0 degree.

7. The conditional for the special-case sp2-sp3 torsion (p. 10029)
   is wrong, and should be inverted - see [4].

8. The overall shape of the UFF torsional potential degenerates to
   a Heavyside function when one of the bond angles becomes linear,
   leading to failures in geometry optimization and force constant
   evaluation. The UFF torsional term was augmented with a smooth
   masking function, to avoid this.

9. UFF inversion potential is not defined in [1] for group 5A
   elements (from phosphorus down). Taking the equilibrium inversion
   coordinate of 87 degree, and the suitable expressions for the
   cosine weights (see uff_get_inversion_shape in "uff_database.f90")
   appears to reproduce published UFF structures and energetics.

The following atom types have been fully tested, and are believed
to reproduce published UFF forcefield results exactly. The examples
refer to the $deMon/examples/test.mm directory.

Additionally, parameter sets for the following atom types are believed
be complete, and may be expected produce results identical to the published
UFF data: Li, Na, K_, Rb, Cs (Note that UFF does not specify atomic charges
- it is your responsibility to assign those, if charges are needed!)

For the remaining atom types, UFF definition [1] relies on an unpublished
set of electronegativities [2]. In deMon, these values were replaced by
Pauling electronegativities, scaled to fit published UFF electronegativities.
This can be expected to produce small deviations in bond lengths and bond
angles, compared to published UFF results.
