#    date:	August 15, 2016
#    purpose:	Chemical input for emc_setup.pl
#
#    notes:
#    	- Create a simulation with 80% m/m water and 20% m/m alcohol
#    	- Alternative to chemistry.esh file, containing an OPTIONS section,
#    	  to be used with emc_setup.pl v1.5 and up
#    	- Allowed separators are commas and tabs, which can be used
#    	  interchangebly
#	- Call with
#
#		emc_setup.pl solution
#
#	  or (for MacOS or Linux)
#
#	  	./solution.esh
#
#	  creates build.emc and solution.in
#

# Options
#
# - Format for options:
#
#	option,value[,...]
#
#   options create a self-contained way of setting up a simulation
# - Replace exisiting scripts
# - Add mass profiles to LAMMPS input script
# - Create a simulation with a target number of 1000 particles
# - Use resulting density of 1 g/cc
# - Use PCFF as force field

ITEM		OPTIONS

replace		true
mass		true
ntotal		1000
density		1
field		pcff
build_dir	.

# Shorthand
#
# - Format for shorthand:
#
#	name,SMILES,fraction[,mol mass[,mol volume]]
#
#   shorthand provides a quick way of constructing a chemistry file

ITEM		SHORTHAND

water		O,80
alcohol		CCO,20

ITEM		END

# Alternative formal way for defining a simulation uses GROUPS and CLUSTERS.
# Swapping the SHORTHAND section out with the sections below results in an
# equivalent simulation definition.

# Comments beginning

ITEM		COMMENTS

# Groups
#
# - Format for groups:
#
#	name,SMILES[,connect index,connect group:connect index[,...]]
#	  
#   where the first connect index is the connection point in the current
#   group and the second in the connection group
# - Asterix in SMILES denotes a connection point

ITEM		GROUPS

water		O
alcohol		CCO

ITEM		END

# Clusters
#
# - Format for clusters:
#	  
#	name,group,fraction[,mol mass[,mol volume]]
#
#   molecular mass and volume are optional and function as an override
#   for mass calculation by means of a force field file; alternatively
#   surfaces can be included by using the group keyword 'surface' through
#	  
#	name,surface,nx,file name
#
#   file name refers to a crystal structure as available in ./lib with
#   nx repeat units in the x direction

ITEM		CLUSTERS

water		water,80
alcohol		alcohol,20
