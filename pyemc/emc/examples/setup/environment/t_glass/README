# Instructions
# ------------
# - Create a base project directory
# 
#     mkdir ./project
# 
# - Copy this setup directory to your project directory
# 
#     cp -pPR $EMC_ROOT/examples/setup/environment/t_glass/setup ./project
# 
# - Execute all setup scripts from the root project directory, e.g.
# 
#     cd ./project
#     ./setup/2018061100.esh
# 
# - Always have a ./project/setup directory in order to use multiple stages
#   within the same project
# - The above structure warrants uniformity for future database solutions
# - Keep a log of which scripts are stored in your ./project/setup directory;
#   see Index below for a suggestion
# 
# Remarks
# -------
# - Log file for explanation of different setup scripts
# - It is advised to use date and serial number in setup script names
# - Simulations create different atactic polymers
# - Different types of analyses are performed
#   - Pressure, energy and density are sampled
#   - Cavity size analysis is performed additionally (see ITEM ANALYSIS
#     paragraph)
