EMC: VMD Extensions
-------------------

EMC offers a plug-in for VMD as a graphical front end to EMC setup.  This
graphical interface is not exhaustive and therefore does not offer all the
possibilities that EMC setup offers.  It is suggested to set the environment
variable EMC_ROOT to the root directory of the active EMC version.  With this
environment variable, packages can be automatically included during VMD start
up by adding the following line to the users' ~/.vmdrc

  source $::env(EMC_ROOT)/vmd/packages.tcl

Replace $::env(EMC_ROOT) by an absolute path, if an independent depency is not
wanted.  Unfortunately, this solution does not apply to the Microsoft Windows
environment.
